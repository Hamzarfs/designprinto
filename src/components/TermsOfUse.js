        <h3>This Guarantee is Limited to:</h3>
        <p>
          This guarantee is restricted to reprinting the original quantity specified in the order using
          the approved artwork files from the initial submission. If we determine that a satisfactory
          result cannot be achieved by replacing the order, Design Printo may, at our discretion, choose
          to refund all or part of the original order cost. Any refund offered, whether partial or full,
          will not cover any shipping or postage costs related to the order.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guarantee excludes any fees or expenses related to mailing services, postage, incidental
          costs, or consequential damages and claims. Design Printo is not accountable for service or
          delivery mistakes made by the United States Postal Service ("USPS"), United Parcel Service ("UPS"),
          Federal Express ("FedEx"), or any other shipping carriers, including loss or delay, and will not
          reimburse for printing, shipping, postage, or handling expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design Printo is not liable for any damages incurred by you or any third party, whether
          consequential, incidental, or otherwise, or for claims arising from receiving printed materials
          that are defective, incomplete, or delivered later than the expected date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your order will adhere to CMYK industry standards for "pleasing color". By placing any order,
          purchasing, or using services, you acknowledge acceptance of these color standards. Our guarantee
          does not cover issues related to color matching. Due to differences in monitor calibrations, ink,
          paper, and constraints throughout the printing processes, we cannot ensure that the final product
          will match the color or density of your personal printer, monitor, or any other method of color
          assessment you may use. Such variations will be deemed acceptable. A hard copy proof of your project
          will provide a more accurate representation of the final product. Minor color discrepancies between
          the hard copy proof and the final produced item may occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design Printo cannot eliminate slight color variations that may occur throughout an order. The
          assessment of slight or minor color shifts is solely at the discretion of Design Printo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design Printo is not responsible for not meeting expected deadlines due to issues with improper
          file composition or changes made to artwork or services during the proofing and production phases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only solution for issues related to defective or manufacturing problems with any order is to
          reprint the order to resolve product defects unless Design Printo determines that a partial or
          full refund is the more suitable option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any refund, reprint, or alternative resolution will not include shipping and handling costs, or
          any expenses related to mailing or postage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design Printo is not responsible for any loss or damage to customer images or artwork. It is your
          responsibility to keep all files and associated artwork stored as you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shipping transit times are not guaranteed. Ground and Freight shipping services are not eligible
          for refunds for any reasons causing a delayed delivery date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage to products occurring after Design Printo's delivery to the shipping agent is not covered
          by this Guarantee. All Design Printo products are shipped F.O.B. Shipping Point, meaning that title
          and risk transfer to you, the customer, once Design Printo delivers to the shipping agent. Orders
          lost or damaged by a shipping agent may be reprinted but do not qualify for a full refund. Any
          costs related to expediting a reprint may be your responsibility.

        <h3>Claims Process</h3>
        <p>To start a complaint process, send an email to <a href="mailto:info@designprinto.com">info@designprinto.com</a>
        or call <a href="tel:+15515543283">(551) 554-3283</a> within 30 days of receiving an order. If the complaint is not 
        released within 30 days, both parties agree that the order is accepted and the printing design meets all conditions, 
        conditions, and management requirements. Once the claim process has begun, we will contact you by phone or email to 
        ensure you have everything we need to process your claim. In some cases, we may ask you to provide images showing the 
        manufacturing issue or defect.</p>

        <p>If we determine that the defect is due to a manufacturing error or is otherwise a defect in the product or service 
          offered by Design Printo, we may, at our discretion, direct you to return the product. If we receive the requested 
          returned defective product, we may reprint your order at our expense from your original files, using the specifications 
          of your original order. We reserve the right to determine if a manufacturing error or defect has occurred.</p>

        <p>Any claims will be limited to reprinting the original ordered quantity using the approved original image file. Reprints 
          do not include shipping or postage costs for your order.</p>

        <p>For projects where a dispute has arisen and we determine a reprint is appropriate, you may not create new files or make 
          changes to files. In these situations, Design Printo reproduces the original approved artwork. All artworks are considered
          a new project or service provided by Design Printo, and the full cost of new projects or services is applied.</p>

        <p>Design Printo may reject any claim brought forward for any reason, including circumstances not covered by this Guarantee.</p>

          manufacturing details, printing and shipping options, postage rates and estimated postage costs, and if you are unclear

          to provide a user quote or create a user project. The estimates or services provided are based on the discretion of

        <ul>

          to the USPS and postal plan acceptance by the USPS.</p>

        <p>Online prices and personalized offers are valid for six months from the date the offer is 
          posted or made available to you. All prices and options displayed on the Site are subject to 
          change without notice.</p>

        <p>All promotions announced by email, online or other communication may only be applied once per order. 
          In no event may multiple discounts or promotions be used on the same order.</p>

        <p>All promotions are limited to a maximum rebate of $250.00 unless expressly stated on the promotion 
          received. Promotion can be terminated at any time at the discretion of Design Printo. Promotion is not 
          a six-month expiration date, even if it is added to the estimate. Design Printo shall not be liable for 
          any damages, whether indirect, incidental or otherwise, suffered by you or any third party, or for any

    <h3>Proofing | File Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PDF or paper proofs are not always provided automatically; it is your responsibility to request one or more additional proofs when placing your order.</li>
        <li>Any electronic proofs requested in .pdf format at the time of order will be downloaded to your account or emailed to you. You will receive an email notification with the option to accept or reject the proof.</li>
        <li>A confirmation will be sent to the email address specified during your order, and it is your responsibility to receive this confirmation. It may take up to 24 hours or more for Design Printo to process each proof.</li>
        <li>Any file issues arising from unusable files or files that are not deemed print-ready by Design Printo will delay the proofing process.</li>
        <li>If proof is provided for your project, it will not be sent to the press without your approval.</li>
        <li>It is the user's responsibility to verify the proof.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for delays in orders due to non-approval or late approval of the proof by the user.</li>
        <li>When viewing a sample, you must enable the overlay settings.</li>
        <li>If the overlay preview settings are disabled, you will not see the overlay.</li>
        <li>To get an accurate proof, you must enable the overprint setting when previewing the proof.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible if the preview settings are incorrect.</li>
        <li>Clients are responsible for setting up files correctly in accordance with our File Guidelines.</li>
        <li>Electronic proofreading is your final opportunity to check aspects of the proof against the original, including layout, bleeds, trimming, fonts and texts, spacing, punctuation, and image placement.</li>
        <li>This is also the last opportunity to change specifications, including order quantities, material specifications, printing, mailing or shipping options.</li>
        <li>Once your proof is approved, your order will go to press and no further changes to your order will be possible.</li>
        <li>We offer paper proofs as a paid service.</li>
        <li>Our paper proofs are the most accurate representation of your print project and are available upon request.</li>
        <li>The solid confirmation of the copy can be considered as the color and saturation, but it is not intended to be used as an accurate color confirmation.</li>
        <li>The difference between the machine with the proof and the device created by the project may differ.</li>
        <li>Different printing devices can cause visual expression differences, but are always in the industrial tolerance of the industry.</li>
        <li>Design Printo calibrates print design and controls the colored calibration of all devices according to the industry standard.</li>
        <li>Paper proofs made on uncoated paper do not provide good color rendition and should not be used for any type of color matching.</li>
        <li>Requesting a paper proof may incur additional fees.</li>
        <li>Hard-copy proof takes time to add. Hard-copy proof is created on the same paper that has been ordered unless it is impossible for Design Printo to provide a proof in an ordered paper. Sample proofs can be provided upon request but may incur an additional charge.</li>
        <li>If Design Printo is unable to provide proofs in this manner, we can create stapled, cut, and folded paper proofs to represent the final product. Any additional charges that may apply will be charged to your credit card at the time your proof is approved and your order is confirmed.</li>
        <li>Requesting proof paper and hard copy proofs takes additional time, and you are responsible for factoring in the additional time when ordering your print.</li>
        <li>It is your responsibility to determine if you require a proof copy and/or paper sample with your print order.</li>

  <h3>Mailing Services</h3>
  <p>Your mailing list(s) are solely yours. We will not use your mailing list for any purpose except to fulfill your order. We do not sell, lease, or market any mailing list data provided by customers. Your mailing lists may be stored in electronic format. Your mailing lists may be shared with third-party vendors to complete mailing tasks related to your project.</p>
  <p>All mailing delivery dates provided are estimates and not guarantees. Design Printo's obligation is limited to preparing your mailing and delivering it to the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). Design Printo's obligation concludes once the job is delivered to either a USPS Business Mail Entry Unit or the Great Falls, Montana Business Mail Entry Unit. Design Printo will not be liable for any failures in performance or delays in delivery by USPS.</p>
  <p>When mailing through USPS, all postage rates are approximations until the USPS has accepted and approved the mailing.</p>
  <p>All online quotes are based solely on mailings within the United States. The estimated prices may change at any moment until the USPS has accepted and approved the mailing. You are responsible for any additional postage charges that may arise.</p>
  <p>Rates may change due to the design of the mail piece, as well as its final weight, size, or shape. Your mailing piece may not meet the USPS standards for barcode readability, which could lead to an increase in postal rates.</p>
  <p>Sending mail to foreign addresses will increase your postage costs. We will only mail to foreign addresses if a written request is submitted at the time of order placement.</p>
  <p>If your mailing does not qualify for automated postal discounts, we will mail it at non-automated rates, leading to higher postage costs. You are responsible for any extra charges incurred for any reason.</p>
  <p>Estimated postage must be prepaid. Payment must be received in full before we can submit your mailing to the USPS. Postage payments may be made via check, PayPal, or credit card. A 5% convenience fee will apply to all postage paid by credit card.</p>
  <p>It is your duty to ensure that the design complies with all postal requirements.</p>
  <p>The USPS does not guarantee the delivery of any First Class or Standard Class Mail.</p>
  <p>Design Printo does not assure delivery times for items sent through the USPS. The time taken for transit varies depending on the destination and the season. All mailing service orders will be handed over to the USPS within 3 Business Days following the printing time of the order. Typical delivery time is between 5-9 business days for First Class Mail and 15+ business days for Standard Class Mail, as applicable.</p>
  <p>Under no circumstances will Design Printo reimburse postage fees for mailed items.</p>
  <p>Postage rates are based on bulk mail pricing for standard, non-profit, and first-class mail from the USPS. The addition of mailing services to your order should be anticipated to extend your shipment date by three business days.</p>
  <p>In the event that there are more mailers than valid entries in the mailing list, the excess products will be discarded or recycled unless you have requested them to be sent to you in writing before the mail date. Additional shipping fees will apply. No refunds will be issued for any products produced but not utilized in a requested mailing service or shipped to you.</p>
  <p>Design Printo is not liable for any confidential or private information included in your printed or produced design.</p>
  <p>Design Printo is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any mailing lists provided by the user. Design Printo will not be held responsible for any failures or delays in USPS performance; for any loss of business; for incidental or consequential damages; or for services billed concerning the particular project.</p>

  <h3>Payment</h3>
  <p>All prices and quantities displayed on this Website are listed in U.S. Dollars (USD), unless specified otherwise. By placing an order for processing to purchase printing products, mailing services, design services, or other offerings, you agree to pay all applicable charges, taxes, and shipping/handling fees using an accepted payment method. Total payment, including shipping costs, must be made at the time you submit an order before processing can commence.</p>
  <p>We accept the following payment methods through the systems of our third-party provider accessible from our Website: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, and PayPal. Any postage paid via credit card incurs a 5% convenience fee based on the amount of postage.</p>
  <p>Cash on delivery ("COD") orders are not accepted.</p>
  <p>Purchase orders will only be considered from Government and Educational organizations upon application approval. Design Printo retains the right to approve or decline any purchase orders or applications at our discretion, with or without justification.</p>
  <p>Customers requesting payment terms must complete our credit application and may be required to sign a personal guarantee to qualify. Design Printo may review any available credit information after the application has been submitted. Design Printo may contact vendor references listed in or provided with the application. It is at the discretion of Design Printo to accept or deny any application for payment terms with or without explanation.</p>
  <p>While Design Printo endeavors to maintain accuracy, we also reserve the right at any point during ordering, manufacturing, shipping, or mailing to correct any discrepancies in pricing, promotions, or descriptions. Design Printo reserves the authority to rectify, cancel, or refuse any order based on incorrect pricing, inaccurate applications, erroneous promotional codes, or any other reasons that may render pricing inaccurate.</p>
  <p>Invoices that remain unpaid after 30 days from the invoice date will incur a finance charge of 1.5% per month (18% annually). Design Printo reserves the right to pursue any and all legal means of collection available under applicable law to recover any overdue amounts. Should Design Printo employ a collections agency or initiate legal proceedings to retrieve an outstanding balance, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, you agree to reimburse us for all costs incurred in recovering said unpaid amount, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses. If you fail to make timely payments, Design Printo may forward your account to an external party for collection, and a collection fee will be charged and will be due upon referral to the third party. This fee will be calculated at the highest percentage allowed by applicable law, not exceeding 18 percent.</p>

<section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Adult Content</h3>
  <p>What one individual finds objectionable might be viewed as artistic expression by another, making it challenging to draw a clear line. Design Printo is a small enterprise, primarily focusing on non-suggestive content that does not feature nudity. Design Printo may opt to print tasteful nudes and boudoir photography. Acceptable examples of such nudes and boudoir work include images that are well-lit, properly posed, and thoughtfully composed. Design Printo retains the right to decline any service or print job involving any form of nudity. We will not accept files or print jobs that we consider suggestive or sexually explicit in any manner, nor if there is uncertainty regarding the models' ages. We will not produce or accept files that could be classified as explicit for any of the following reasons: any depiction of nude sexual acts; any content regarded as pornographic; any nudity with a highly suggestive sexual connotation; and any images that depict the exploitation or harm of minors, including content that contravenes state or federal child pornography laws, child exploitation regulations, and laws prohibiting the representation of minors in sexual situations. If there is any ambiguity regarding the ages of the models, we may submit materials to the relevant authorities for further investigation. The decision to provide services for any project rests solely with Design Printo. We maintain the right to refuse service for any reason, or without providing one.</p>

  <h3>Referral Program</h3>
  <p>As a member of the Refer-a-Friend program (referred to as a “Referrer”), you must adhere to 
    Design Printo’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (both accessible on our website), along with 
    the following additional Terms & Conditions for the Refer-a-Friend initiative:</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Qualified Referral.</h3>
  <p>A Qualified Referral is characterized as a purchase made at www.DesignPrinto.com by an 
    individual (termed a "Referred Customer") who visits our site by clicking on your 
    Refer-a-Friend link. You can receive credit for only one Qualified Referral per Referred 
    Customer; this means that additional or repeat purchases made by the same Referred Customer 
    will not count as separate Qualified Referrals. To be eligible, the purchase needs to be 
    completed on our website.</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Referred Customer.</h3>
  <p>The Referred Customer and the Referrer cannot be the same individual (for instance, using a 
    different email address does not qualify). The Referred Customer must be a new customer who 
    does not reside in the same household as the Referrer.</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Referral Rewards.</h3>
  <p>In order to earn referral rewards as a Referrer, the Referred Customer must make a purchase 
    exceeding $100.00 in total value, excluding all fees such as taxes, discounts, shipping costs, 
    returns, chargebacks, fraudulent transactions, or other third-party charges. Rewards apply only 
    to the Referred Customer’s initial purchase. The total rewards a Referrer can earn each year is 
    capped at $5,000.</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Reward Payments.</h3>
  <p>Rewards will be issued as gift cards or account credits. The maximum number of Qualified 
    Referrals a Referrer can earn per calendar year is limited to 50. As a Referrer, you are 
    accountable for any and all tax obligations arising from Referral Rewards. The Referred 
    Customer will receive a 15% discount (up to $300 off, with a minimum purchase requirement 
    of $100.00).</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Eligibility.</h3>
  <p>This program is exclusively available to individuals. Design Printo’s Refer-a-Friend 
    Program cannot be utilized by businesses for lead generation in an affiliate context, 
    as determined solely by Design Printo's discretion.</p>
    </section>

  
  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>No Spam.</h3>
  <p>You must adhere to all current “SPAM” legislation. For instance, emails should be 
    crafted and sent in a personal manner, and bulk email distribution is highly discouraged. 
    Any attempts to share your referral link that might be considered unsolicited commercial 
    email or "spam" under any applicable laws or regulations are strictly prohibited and may 
    result in the immediate termination of your account and exclusion from Design Printo’s 
    Refer-a-Friend program.</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Right to Close Accounts.</h3>
  <p>Design Printo maintains the authority to close the accounts of any Referrer and/or 
    Referred Customer, and to demand proper payment if they suspect the Referrer and/or 
    Referred Customer is misusing the Refer-a-Friend program or violating these Terms & 
    Conditions or any applicable laws, statutes, or regulations.</p>
    </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Right to Cancel Program or Change Terms.</h3>
  <p>Design Printo reserves the right to terminate the Refer-a-Friend Program or alter these 
    Terms & Conditions at any time at its discretion. Any referral rewards that are not claimed 
    will be forfeited under such circumstances.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Cancellations</h3>
  <p>In case of any cancellation, you agree to pay a cancellation fee along with any additional charges related to 
    the work completed or expenses incurred by Design Printo up until that time. If a period of 21 days passes, it 
    may result in an automatic cancellation initiated by Design Printo, incurring a cancellation fee of $35.00.
   </p>
   <p>
    The customer will be notified of such cancellation 5 days before it occurs and will have the chance to discuss 
    and finalize the order during that period. After the 5 days, any refunds or charges will be processed, and the 
    customer will receive the final cancellation notice. Design Printo retains the right to cancel an order at any 
    time if we determine that the submitted files do not meet our print-ready standards, with or without making efforts 
    to have the files corrected or resubmitted by the customer. At Design Printo's discretion, we may opt to cancel an
     order for any reason and without justification. In such cases, no cancellation fee will be imposed, but charges 
     for the work completed up to that point may apply.</p>
</section>
