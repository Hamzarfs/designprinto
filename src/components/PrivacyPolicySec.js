      <p>
        Most web browsers, by default, accept cookies unless you have set them not to.

        may be found on the Website's pages and in emails we send. Web beacons or similar technologies can be employed for various reasons, such as counting 
        visitors to the Website, tracking your navigation on the Website, or tallying how many specific articles or links on the Website were actually viewed.  
      </p>
    </section>
    <section className="mb-4">
      <p>
        <strong>Mobile Device Identifiers</strong> - Mobile Device Identifiers - Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices, 
        and we, our Partners, or our third-party service providers might acquire such device information if you access the Website via 
        a mobile device. Some features on the Website may necessitate the collection of mobile phone numbers, which we may link to mobile 
        device identification data. Furthermore, some mobile service providers have systems that determine the physical location of devices 
        using their services. Depending on the provider, we, our Partners, or our third-party service providers may receive this Information. 
      </p>

        including the links you click. The code is temporarily downloaded from our web server or a third-party provider and remains
        active only while you are connected to the Website, becoming inactive or deleted once you leave.

      <p>
        This Privacy Statement does not cover any Information you may provide to unaffiliated third parties, such as other websites linked to this Website with which we do not have a relationship. If you access our Website through a Third Party Website, you may also need to review and accept the terms and conditions and Privacy Statement of that Third Party Website.

        <h3>4. Protection of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We employ standard industry practices and measures to help protect the confidentiality of your Information. However, it would help
          if you recognized that no data transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed as completely secure. Thus, while the steps we've
          taken minimize the potential for security issues to a level that is suitable for the type of data involved, we do not make any
          promises or guarantees. It would help if you did not assume that your Information or private communications will consistently
          remain confidential. We cannot guarantee that your Information will not be misappropriated or disclosed to third parties. We will
          not be liable for any misuse or disclosure of your Information.

          will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By utilizing the Website or submitting any Information to us, you
